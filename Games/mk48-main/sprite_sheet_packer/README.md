# Mk48.io Spritesheet Packer

Run this to read entities, additional textures, animations, and audio sprites (mostly in the `/assets` directory) and pack them into various spritesheets (mostly in the `/js/public` directory).

```console
$ cargo run --release
```

You have to re-run this if any of the above change.
